    "Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a federal agency acting under the Department of Homeland Security. The main responsibilities of ICE include enforcing immigration law, preventing terrorism, and stopping illegal movement of people and goods within the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for exploring our topic lies in the dramatic increase in funding that ICE has received with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Prior to the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ICE received about 10 dollars billion in budget per year. After passing, funding increased to 85 billion dollars. With the marked uptick in funding, activity, and media coverage, ICE has become a hotly contested topic for the American public in recent months, especially with notable incidents involving Renee Good and Alex Pretti. We will attempt to gain a better understanding of the efficacy of ICE on reducing violent and property crime.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "An article published in the The Journal of Law & Economics by Thomas J. Miles and Adam B. Cox examined the relationship between immigration enforcement and local US crime rates. The research specifically investigates the effect of the Secure Communities program. The Secure Communities program uses fingerprint-sharing between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities to facilitate detention and removal of noncitizens. This is not a direct correlate to ICE, however, it may serve as a proxy to understand whether or not strict enforcement of immigration policy reduces crime. The conclusion of the study showed that the Secure Communities program led to hundreds of thousands of detentions, but did not reduce crime-rates as expected.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The article Immigration and Customs Enforcement Raids the Pillar of a Community: Student Achievement, Absenteeism, and Mobility Following a Large Worksite Enforcement Operation in North Texas looks at the effects that ICE had through various time extents. It serves as a point of interest as to why Texas was chosen for this project, as well as a way to question what sort of empirical and statistical impact ICE had.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of all states affected by ICE, Texas stands out in the number and scale of people detained. According to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) Immigration, there are 18,684 people in detention, as of January 22, 2026, which makes Texas the state with the most ICE detainees followed by Louisiana, 8,207 people, and California, 6,422. Geographically, Texas shares the longest border between the U.S. and Mexico, stretching 382 miles, with more than 40 border security stations across 5 sectors. The sheer size of the border and affiliated border control stations are key in understanding the subsequent size of detainees in Texas, which should be considered when examining the correlation between violent crime and ICE arrests. While Texas holds the greatest number of detainees, it is critical to understand that detention location is not the same as arrest location. Texas maintains some of the largest ICE detention centers in the country, where those arrested by ICE both in and out of Texas may be placed into. Therefore it is more representative to examine arrests per capita, to measure the presence of ICE in Texas independent from other states.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4,</sup>](#cite_note-4)<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",

For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be some sources of bias in our data, for example since the ICE arrest records come from ICE themselves, we do not know if they choose to leave certain arrests unrecorded. The same type of bias also applies to the data of crime rate, since some crimes may go unrecorded. Also, there could be bias in the way that the data was recorded across different areas, for instance some places could be more strict in what they record than others. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we are using does not use personally identifiable information.  The data sources has encrypted any identifying documents. We still have data about demographics and location, but people’s personal information is safe. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods used in this project should be able to be applied on data collected in the future so long as the formatting of data is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our data was obtained from reputable open sources, the danger of exposing personal information was extremely minimal. While encryption at rest and in transit is not applicable, our data will be stored on the private team project repository only accessible by invited members on Github. Any changes to our data will be recorded by version control, to minimize accidental deletion or modifications.  \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will only be accessed during the progression of the project and later deleted from our local systems upon completion. The data will exist in the Github repository with no plan to delete it for future academic purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan on making sure that we do not reinforce harmful stereotypes by discussing amongst each other as well as reaching out to those in affected communities\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are aware of the possibilities of misreporting statistics and other variables and will try to account for this error\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only present what the data shows and not draw any unnecessary conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "    \n",
    "This data doesn't use personally identifiable information. In case we come across this, we will not display any unnecessary data that may break privacy. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will document our process of analysis with explanations of our findings. The documentation of our analysis will include every step we took to analyze the data so that it will be reproducible in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
